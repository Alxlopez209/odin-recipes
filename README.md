# odin-recipes
My First Odin Project as a web developer!
I created a recipe page of my three favorite Mexican dishes! I used a simple HTML layout but hopefully I'm able to incorporate CSS soon.
I used lists, img, anchor, and paragraph elements meanwhile incorporating different attributes within those elements; such as, href and alt attributes.
